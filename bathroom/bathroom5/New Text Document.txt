Complete Restroom Renovation —

Father’s House Church

All restrooms at Father’s House Church — women’s, men’s, and

children’s — were completely redesigned and rebuilt by several members of our church, including StyleHomes.
Each space was created as a custom project, combining functionality, cleanliness, and a modern aesthetic.

The women’s restroom features a double sink with two height levels — one for adults and one for children — and a full-height mirror for convenience.
The men’s restroom carries the same thoughtful design, with warm wood accents, black fixtures, and marble-style walls.
The children’s restroom, located near the classrooms, was also designed individually to look bright, modern, and welcoming for kids.

Every element was carefully planned — from easy maintenance to hidden plumbing — making each space both practical and elegant.
