Warm Coastal Bathroom —

Project for BTN Homes

This bathroom is part of an ocean-view home completed for BTN Homes. The combination of natural brown cabinetry and warm tile tones creates a cozy, relaxing atmosphere that fits perfectly with the coastal surroundings.

The gentle lighting and woven pendant fixture add a soft, welcoming feel to the space.
These bathrooms were beautifully finished by the StyleHomes team, bringing warmth and elegance to modern coastal living.
