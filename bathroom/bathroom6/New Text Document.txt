Bathroom & Vanity Project

Modern bathrooms and custom vanities designed and built by StyleHomes.
Each space was created with a clean and elegant aesthetic — marble-patterned walls, wood-tone cabinets, and matte-black fixtures perfectly combine style and functionality.
Every detail, from the shower design to the cabinet layout, was carefully planned to achieve a refined and contemporary look.
