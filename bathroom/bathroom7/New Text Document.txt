Bathroom & Vanity Project — BTN Home

Modern bathrooms and custom vanities designed and built by StyleHomes for BTN Home.
Each space was created with an individual approach — combining natural wood textures, elegant lighting, and matte black fixtures for a warm and sophisticated look.
The cabinetry design provides a clean floating effect, while every

detail — from tile layout to faucet choice — was carefully planned to achieve both beauty and practicality.
