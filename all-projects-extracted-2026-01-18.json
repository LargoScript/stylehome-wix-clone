The property was sold immediately after being listed — a testament to the timeless design and attention to detail. The kitchen, all bedroom cabinets, interior doors, baseboards, and full millwork were designed and installed by StyleHomes and DreamCabinets. Together, we brought the designer’s vision to life, combining precision craftsmanship with modern aesthetics. Our portfolio includes full project photo sets — from kitchen and cabinets to doors, shelves, and all finishing details — so you can see the complete transformation of each home we’ve worked on.
