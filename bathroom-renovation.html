Each space was created as a custom project, combining functionality, cleanliness, and a modern aesthetic. The women’s restroom features a double sink with two height levels — one for adults and one for children — and a full-height mirror for convenience.
The men’s restroom carries the same thoughtful design, with warm wood accents, black fixtures, and marble-style walls.
